### 4. cns (Contract Management Service)

The Contract Management Service provides management functions for contracts in the system, including contract registration and cancellation, contract registration information and address inquiry.

PlatONE uses the system contract to implement the contract management service. After the user deploys the contract, the contract can be registered in the system contract. Subsequent calls can be called by the contract name and version without using the contract address.
